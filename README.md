Objects are located by drawing a bounding box around the detected object. One of computer vision's specialties is 
object detection, which finds things in an image or video. Techniques for object detection are the foundation of the area of 
artificial intelligence. Typically, object detection uses deep learning and machine learning to yield accurate and significant 
findings. It is essentially made up of localization and classification. The state-of-the-art techniques utilized for real-time object 
detection have advanced recently. This study paper compares state-of-the-art techniques, such as faster region convolutional 
neural networks (Faster R-CNN) and you only look once V8 (YOLOV8). These algorithms are deep neural network 
representations, or neural networks with numerous hidden layers. Although each of these algorithms is notable for its own 
distinctiveness, they are compared to see which is superior. This study focuses on determining which of these algorithms is more 
practical to employ despite sharing a common core, namely CNNs.
